### Consider donating to the class!  

Donation methods:

  - [paypal.me/hackerfood](paypal.me/hackerfood)
    is our class paypal link to donate money for food
    and equipment.

    Even $30 helps defray costs, $500 will pay for a lab's worth of food,
    $2k will pay for a section leader (our default staff budget is seriously
    inadequate), and $25k can cover the quarter.

    Note: this paypal method doesn't give a tax write-off.  On the other
    hand, there is zero administrative overhead, so the money goes right to
    the students.  

    We're happy to send a photo of the receipt and food; or add a
    "sponsors" list if that is useful.  (I can also provide btc or
    eth links.)

  - For larger amounts where a tax write off is needed:
    email directly (engler@stanford.edu) to start the gift donation
    process through official Stanford channels.  One caveat: after
    some of the recent scandals you might have seen in the news, gift
    donations have become a several month affair.  (E.g., Meta donated
    last year and it took about 3 months.)

  - We also take interesting equipment donations!   Anything with a 
    datasheet and 60+ quantities is potentially useful.

As always, all 140E class course materials are provided, free, in our github
repo, so helping this class helps others, too.

This quarter (2023) the class is 60 students, and meets from tue/th 5:30pm
--- midnight.  We provide all equipment and since the class is so long
and not easy, we provide food.

As with all past years, I largely pay for both food and equipment money
using my Stanford salary.  As the class size grows, this expense is
on track to get close to half my take-home pay.  E.g., even with cheap
domino's pizza with all coupons the food budget is going to be around
$1000 a week.  (So about 4k a month.) 

You would think Stanford would pay for food and equipment, but they
do not.    

In any case, the students have to get fed and equip'd, so please donate
if you find the material useful.
